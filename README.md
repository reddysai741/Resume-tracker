# Smart Resume Matcher with AI-Powered HR Messaging

This Streamlit-based web application helps job seekers match their resume against a job posting, calculate an ATS compatibility score, and generate a professional job application email. It extracts resume data from a PDF (up to 200MB) and job details from a provided URL using `PyPDF2` and `WebBaseLoader`.
Using NLP techniques with `nltk` and `scikit-learn`, it computes a cosine similarity score (e.g., 36.28%) to determine ATS compatibility. The app leverages `langchain-groq` to interact with the Grok API for JSON extraction and email generation. Features include resume upload, job URL input, JSON output of extracted data, ATS score display, and email generation. To set up, clone the repository (`git clone <repository-url>`), navigate to the folder (`cd <repository-folder>`), and install dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`). Required packages are `streamlit`, `PyPDF2`, `langchain-groq`, `langchain-community`, `beautifulsoup4`, `nltk`, and `scikit-learn`. 
Set your Grok API key securely using environment variables (`export GROQ_API_KEY='your-api-key'`) or Streamlit secrets in `.streamlit/secrets.toml` ([secrets] GROQ_API_KEY = "your-api-key"). Run the app with `streamlit run app.py`, then access it at `http://localhost:8501`. 
Upload a resume PDF, enter a job posting URL (e.g., https://amazon.jobs/en/jobs/2979106/applied-scientist-i-amazon-payments-team), and click "Process Resume and Job Posting" to view extracted JSONs, ATS score, and a generated email. The screenshot below shows the interface with a drag-and-drop resume upload area and a job description URL input field:

The project structure includes `app.py` (main script), `requirements.txt` (dependencies), and `images/` (for the screenshot). Note that the app requires a valid Grok API key, assumes the job URL is accessible, and calculates ATS scores using text preprocessing and cosine similarity. Future dates in resumes (e.g., April 2025) may need handling, and the API key should be secured. This project is licensed under the MIT License; see the `LICENSE` file for details.
